\title{Soil class probabilities}
\usage{
calc_probabilities(input = NULL, n_iterations = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{A vector of integers n soil classes long, where the integers refer to counts of soil
classes.}

\item{n_iterations}{Integer; the total number of model runs.}
}
\value{
An atomic vector of probabilities, or a vector of NA values of the same length.
e.g. for 20 model runs, 0 5 8 0 becomes 0 0.25 0.4 0.
}
\description{
Converts the number of times a soil class was predicted to a probability by normalising against
the total number of model runs.
}
\note{
This is a helper function and not widely applicable. It is expected to be used in concert
with \code{\link[raster:calc]{calc}}, applied to a stack of tabulated class counts produced
by \code{\link[dsmartr:collate]{collate}}.
